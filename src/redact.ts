 * Redaction is deliberately **best effort**: it recognises known credential
 * shapes (GitHub tokens, Stellar secret seeds, URL userinfo/query strings, and
 * values of environment variables whose names look sensitive) and masks them
 * with {@link REDACTED}. A secret that matches none of those shapes can still
 * slip through, which is exactly why the diagnostics artifact is opt-in.
 *
 * The process environment is never dumped into a diagnostic tail; only the
 * values of variables whose *names* look sensitive are used as search
 * patterns. Nothing here reads, logs, or serializes `process.env` itself.
