[![CI](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action)](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action/releases) [![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The official GitHub Actions integration for [Stellar Protocol
Canary](https://github.com/StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary). It makes Stellar
protocol compatibility testing a normal part of GitHub CI.

## What it does

This Action is a thin wrapper around the real `stellar-canary` CLI. It does
not know what CAP-83 or CAP-85 mean, does not reimplement XDR/RPC/Soroban
testing, and never reinterprets a compatibility result the CLI didn't
report. It:

1. installs the requested `Protocol-Canary` version (from source, pinned —
   see [Installation & integrity](#installation--integrity));
2. runs `stellar-canary check --format json` with your inputs;
3. publishes a GitHub job summary and (optionally) annotations from that
   JSON;
4. optionally uploads the JSON report as a workflow artifact;
5. passes or fails the job according to Canary's own exit code — never a
   result the Action computed itself.

All compatibility logic lives in
[`StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`](https://github.com/StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary).
Canonical fixtures live in
[`StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures`](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures).

## Prerequisites

Before following the quick-start example, make sure the runner meets the
requirements below:

- A Rust/Cargo toolchain is available. This Action installs
  `Protocol-Canary` from source with `cargo install --git`, so a
  self-hosted or non-Ubuntu runner must install Rust first; GitHub-hosted
  Ubuntu runners include Cargo by default.
- The `version` input matches a real release tag in
  `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`. It is pinned to a specific upstream
  release and never tracks `main`.

See [Installation & integrity](#installation--integrity) and the `version`
entry in [Inputs](#inputs) for the full explanation and setup guidance.

## Quick start

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action@v1
  with:
    protocol: "28"
```

This snippet is not runnable on its own: `fixtures-dir` defaults to
`fixtures`, relative to the job's working directory, and a freshly
checked-out project normally has no `fixtures/` directory, so there is
nothing for Canary to check. Either point `fixtures-dir` at your own
fixtures or check out a fixtures pack first, as
[`examples/protocol-28.yml`](examples/protocol-28.yml) does.

See [`examples/`](examples/) for the complete, runnable workflows —
including that Protocol 28 one, which checks out the real
`ProtocolCanary-Fixtures` pack and sets `fixtures-dir` to match — and for
one that runs on a self-hosted runner
([`examples/self-hosted.yml`](examples/self-hosted.yml)).

## Example workflow

```yaml
name: Stellar Compatibility

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  compatibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action@v1
        with:
          protocol: "28"
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | Target Stellar protocol version (`--protocol`). | (from `.stellar-canary.toml`, or 28) |
| `config` | Path to `.stellar-canary.toml` (`--config`). Fails clearly if the given path does not exist, or is not a regular file (e.g. a directory). | (CLI default lookup) |
| `network` | Network for live RPC/Soroban checks (`--network`). | `testnet` (CLI default) |
| `rpc-url` | Stellar RPC endpoint (`--rpc-url`). Must be `https://`, or `http://localhost`/`127.0.0.1` for local development. | (none) |
| `fixtures-dir` | Path to a directory of fixtures, e.g. a checkout of `ProtocolCanary-Fixtures` (`--fixtures-dir`). | `fixtures` |
| `version` | `Protocol-Canary` version to install, without a leading `v`. Pinned — never tracks `main`. | `0.1.1` |
| `upload-report` | Upload the JSON report as a workflow artifact. | `true` |
| `annotations` | Emit GitHub annotations for failures/warnings/errors. | `true` |
| `allow-empty` | Let a run that executes no checks pass (`--allow-empty`). Only meaningful with `version: 0.2.0` or newer, which fail such a run by default; older versions already pass it, so the flag is not forwarded to them. | `false` |
| `timeout-minutes` | Maximum time to let Canary run before it is terminated. Also bounds the `cargo install` step (floored at one minute) — see [Timeouts](#timeouts). | `15` |
| `fixtures-pack-version` | Release tag of the fixture pack to run against, e.g. `v1.2.0` (leading `v` optional); unpinned values like `latest` are rejected. **Accepted and validated, but not forwarded to Canary** — it has no fixture-pack flag, so the run still reads whatever `fixtures-dir` points at. Pin the pack by checking out its tag into `fixtures-dir`. | (none) |
| `fixtures-pack-protocol` | Protocol version the pack is pinned to, as a positive integer (`0` is rejected here, unlike `protocol`). **Accepted and validated, but not forwarded to Canary** — see above. The protocol a run checks is `protocol`. | (none) |

There is deliberately no `format` input: the Action always requests
`--format json` from the CLI (the only way it can build the summary and
annotations), and never invokes Canary twice to get a second format.

## Outputs

All values are strings, as GitHub Actions outputs always are. The counts
(`passed`, `warnings`, `failures`, `errors`) are decimal-string integers
(rendered with `String(n)`), and `status` is one of the five fixed
literals below.

| Output | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `pass`, `warning`, `fail`, `error`, or `execution-failed` (the Action's own value when Canary could not produce a report at all — see below). | `"fail"` |
| `passed` | Number of checks that passed. | `"12"` |
| `warnings` | Number of checks that produced a warning. | `"1"` |
| `failures` | Number of checks that failed a compatibility assertion. | `"2"` |
| `errors` | Number of checks that could not complete due to an execution error. | `"0"` |
| `report` | Absolute path to the generated JSON report file. Only set when Canary produced output to parse; empty/unset on an execution failure (`status` `execution-failed`). | `/home/runner/work/_temp/stellar-canary-report.json` |

A concrete consumer, using the outputs to gate a follow-up step:

```yaml
- uses: StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action@v1
  id: canary
  with:
    protocol: "28"
- name: React to the result
  if: steps.canary.outputs.status == 'fail'
  run: echo "${{ steps.canary.outputs.failures }} check(s) failed"

> **Note:** When `status` is `execution-failed`, the numeric outputs (`passed`, `warnings`, `failures`, `errors`) are all explicitly set to the string `"0"`. They do **not** represent a real count of zero compatibility issues — they indicate that Canary never produced a report at all. Always check `status` first before relying on the counts.

## How failures appear

The Action distinguishes two different kinds of "red":

- **A compatibility failure** — Canary ran successfully and found a real
  incompatibility. `status` is `fail` (or `warning`/`error`); the job
  summary shows a per-surface table and the specific failing test IDs;
  annotations point at each one.
- **An execution failure** — Canary could not be installed, could not run,
  timed out, or produced output that could not be parsed as a report.
  `status` is `execution-failed`; the summary says "Protocol Canary could
  not be executed" with the actual diagnostic, never a fabricated
  compatibility message.

A separate failure — the job summary itself failing to publish — is
reported as "Failed to publish Canary summary," distinct from both of the
above.

### Annotation limits

GitHub enforces a platform-level cap on how many annotations are surfaced
in the UI per step and per workflow run, and silently drops any beyond
that cap. This Action emits one annotation per failing, erroring, or
warning result and does not batch or truncate, so a very large fixture set
— or a run with many simultaneous failures — can produce more annotations
than GitHub will display.

That cap applies only to annotations. The job summary and the JSON report
list every result regardless, so treat them, not the annotations, as the
complete record of what Canary found. See GitHub's
[workflow command documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-commands)
for the platform's exact behavior.
### What the job summary looks like

The summary is rendered by `renderSummaryMarkdown` in
[`src/summary.ts`](src/summary.ts). A passing run over three surfaces, with a
network configured and one fixture skipped:

```markdown
## Stellar Protocol Canary

Protocol: 28
Project: my-soroban-contracts (soroban)
Network: testnet — observed protocol 28
Canary version: 0.1.1

| Surface | Result |
|---|---|
| XDR | ✅ PASS (2/2) |
| RPC | ✅ PASS (1/1) |
| Soroban | ✅ PASS (1/1) |

### Result

✅ **PASS**

4/4 applicable checks passed.

<details><summary>Skipped fixtures</summary>

- `p27-xdr-legacy` (xdr) — fixture targets protocol 27, this run targets protocol 28

</details>
```

And a run with a failing check, a warning, and a check that could not complete:

```markdown
## Stellar Protocol Canary

Protocol: 28
Project: my-soroban-contracts (soroban)
Network: testnet — observed protocol 28
Canary version: 0.1.1

| Surface | Result |
|---|---|
| XDR | ❌ FAIL (1/2) |
| RPC | ⚠️ WARNING (0/1) |
| Soroban | ❌ FAIL (0/1) |

### Result

❌ **NOT READY**

1/4 applicable checks passed.

#### Failures

- `p28-xdr-cap85-002` (xdr) — transaction envelope metadata differs from the expected encoding
  expected discriminant 3, found 2
  at line 1, column 24
- `p28-soroban-invoke-004` (soroban) — simulateInvoke could not reach the configured RPC endpoint
  connect ETIMEDOUT 10.0.0.1:443

#### Warnings

- `p28-rpc-getledgerentries-003` (rpc) — RPC endpoint returned HTTP 429; result may be incomplete
```

When Canary could not be run at all, the summary says so explicitly instead —
`renderExecutionFailureMarkdown`:

````markdown
## Stellar Protocol Canary

### Result

🚫 **ERROR**

Protocol Canary could not be executed.

Reason: Stellar Protocol Canary timed out after 900s and was terminated.

```text
(no diagnostic output)
```
````

More examples — including the surface ordering, the skipped-fixtures block, and
the no-results case — live in
[`tests/unit/summary.test.ts`](tests/unit/summary.test.ts), which renders
these fixtures through the same function.

Annotations from this Action are workflow-level only: no fixture in the
report schema carries a file/line location, so they appear in the
workflow run's Checks output and logs, never inline on a pull request's
file diff the way file-scoped annotations from other tools do. The Action
never fabricates a location.

**GitHub annotation limits:** GitHub Actions caps the number of annotations
rendered per run (10 per step, 50 per job across error+warning combined).
When a run produces more failing results than this limit, GitHub silently
drops annotations past the cap. The job summary table and failure list
generated by this Action **always include every result** from the full JSON
report, regardless of annotation count. If you see fewer annotations than
failures in the summary, this is why.

## Troubleshooting

Every failure is one of the two kinds described above: a real
compatibility result (`status` `fail`/`warning`/`error`) or the Action
failing to run Canary at all (`status` `execution-failed`). The [bug
report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)'s "Which kind of
failure?" checklist asks you to pick between exactly those two before you
file — the table below maps the most common execution-failure messages to
what to do about each.

| Message (step log / job summary) | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| ``The `cargo` command was not found on this runner. …`` | No Rust toolchain is available, so the Action cannot build Canary from source. | On a self-hosted or non-Ubuntu runner, install a toolchain first — e.g. a `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` step ahead of this Action; [`examples/self-hosted.yml`](examples/self-hosted.yml) shows a complete workflow. GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners include one by default; seeing this there usually means an earlier step removed it from `PATH`. |
| ``` `cargo install` exited with code 101 while installing Protocol-Canary … ``` | The source build failed — most often a Rust toolchain too old for Canary's `Cargo.toml`, a corrupted build cache, or a transient network failure while fetching crates. | Re-run the job once to rule out a transient failure. If it persists, update the runner's Rust toolchain. Cargo's own error output appears in the log above this message; `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true` adds more detail. |
| `Stellar Protocol Canary timed out after Ns and was terminated.` | Canary ran longer than `timeout-minutes` (default 15; it bounds only the Canary process, not the whole job) and was killed. | Raise `timeout-minutes` if your fixture set legitimately needs longer. Otherwise check whether a live-RPC check is hanging on an unreachable `rpc-url`. |
| `` `cargo install` … timed out after Ns and was terminated. `` | The `cargo install` step ran longer than `timeout-minutes` (floored at one minute — see [Timeouts](#timeouts)) and was killed. | Re-run the job; this is usually a stalled network fetch. Raise `timeout-minutes` if a build of this size legitimately needs longer. Cargo's own progress output appears in the log above this message. |
| `Failed to start …: spawn … ENOENT` | The installed Canary binary could not be launched at all. | Typical on a self-hosted runner with an incompatible architecture or libc. Verify the runner can execute binaries built by its own toolchain, then re-run the job to force a fresh install. |
| `Canary produced no output to parse as a JSON report.` / `Canary's output could not be parsed as JSON: …` | Canary exited without emitting a valid JSON report on stdout — killed mid-run, crashed, or a release this Action cannot parse. | Re-run the job. The step log shows the exact command the Action ran; run it locally to see Canary's stderr. Check that `version` is one of the releases in the [supported versions table](#supported-canary-versions) — older releases' reports predate the `counts` field this Action accepts. |
| `Unsupported report schemaVersion N (this Action supports schemaVersion 1).` | The installed Canary release emits a newer report schema than this Action understands. | Pin `version` to a release from the supported versions table, or wait for a release of this Action that declares support for the new schema (schema changes are called out in [Versioning](#versioning)). |
| `Configuration file not found: <path>` | The `config` input names a file that does not exist. | Fix the path (it is resolved against the job's working directory) or check out the file before this step. |
| `Failed to publish Canary summary.` | The GitHub job summary could not be written — an infrastructure problem, distinct from both failure kinds above. | Re-run the job; if it reproduces on a GitHub-hosted runner, file a bug with the run link. |

`Invalid "…" input` messages (`protocol`, `config`, `rpc-url`, `version`,
`timeout-minutes`, and the boolean inputs) state the expected format in
the message itself; see [Inputs](#inputs) for each input's accepted
values.

## Timeouts

The `timeout-minutes` input bounds the time this Action spends on the two
long-running operations it controls:

- **The Canary process** (`stellar-canary check`): terminated when it runs
  longer than `timeout-minutes`.
- **The installation** (`cargo install --git … canary-cli`, a network- and
  build-bound operation): also terminated when it runs longer than
  `timeout-minutes`, with a one-minute floor so a very small `timeout-minutes`
  set purely for the check cannot break installation. A timed-out install
  fails the step with a distinct "`cargo install` … timed out" message rather
  than the check's "Stellar Protocol Canary timed out" message.

In both cases the hung process is sent `SIGTERM` and, if it ignores that,
`SIGKILL` after a short grace period, so neither operation can block the job
until GitHub's much longer job-level `timeout-minutes` steps in with a
generic error and no Canary diagnostic.

GitHub Actions' own job- and step-level `timeout-minutes` are unrelated: set
any surrounding job- or step-level timeout comfortably higher than this
input, or GitHub's timeout can terminate the step first.

## Artifacts

When `upload-report: true` (the default), the JSON report is uploaded as a
workflow artifact named `stellar-protocol-canary-report`. Artifact upload
is always auxiliary: if it fails, the underlying compatibility result is
unaffected, and a warning is logged rather than the job failing on that
account alone.

GitHub requires artifact names to be unique within a workflow run, so a
second invocation — a matrix leg, or a second Action step checking another
network or protocol — would otherwise collide with the first. The Action
handles this automatically: **the first invocation keeps the stable name
`stellar-protocol-canary-report`**, and a later invocation whose upload is
rejected because that name is taken retries under a suffixed name derived
from the inputs that distinguish it, for example
`stellar-protocol-canary-report-protocol-28-network-testnet`. (When no
inputs distinguish the invocation, a short unique suffix is used instead.)

This means existing single-step workflows keep the exact artifact name
they have always had, while multi-invocation workflows collect one report
per invocation instead of silently dropping every upload after the first.
Downloading a specific report from a multi-invocation run therefore means
matching the suffix — either the protocol/network/config it checked, or the
generated unique suffix when the invocations share the same inputs.

## Installation & integrity

`Protocol-Canary` does not yet publish prebuilt release binaries or
checksums (see its own `docs/json-report-contract.md` and this Action's
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). This Action installs it with `cargo install
--git`, pinned to the immutable commit the requested version's tag
resolved to at run time (falling back to the tag itself, with a warning, if
that resolution fails) — see `src/version.ts` and `src/canary.ts`. This
requires a Rust/Cargo toolchain on the runner; GitHub-hosted Ubuntu
runners include one by default. A self-hosted or non-Ubuntu runner must
install one before this Action runs — see
[`examples/self-hosted.yml`](examples/self-hosted.yml) for a complete
workflow that does this with `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` ahead of invoking
this Action. A successful build is cached (best-effort; never required for
correctness) using `actions/cache`.

This Action is also a JavaScript action, declared as `runs: using: node24`
in `action.yml`, so the runner must additionally provide the Node 24
Actions runtime. GitHub-hosted runners always satisfy this; a self-hosted
runner needs an
[Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases) version new
enough to bundle Node 24 (v2.328.0 or later), or the step fails to start
with an opaque runtime error before Canary is ever installed or run.

## Versioning

This repository follows semver and publishes a floating `v1` tag pointing
at the latest `v1.x.y` release, per standard GitHub Actions convention. The
release workflow moves that tag automatically when a new `vX.Y.Z` tag is
pushed (and only ever forwards, never backwards), so `@v1` always resolves
to the newest `v1.x.y` release. The `version` input is unrelated to this
Action's own version: it selects which `Protocol-Canary` release to install
and run.

```yaml
- uses: StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action@v1 # floating major tag
- uses: StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Action@v1.2.3 # pinned to an exact release
```

Prefer `@v1` to receive fixes automatically within `v1`; pin to an exact
tag like `@v1.2.3` when you need full reproducibility (consistent with the
`version` input, which is pinned and never tracks `main`).

### Supported Canary versions

| Action | Protocol-Canary |
|---|---|
| v1 | `0.1.1` (default; `0.1.0` also installable, but predates the `ContractExecutable` XDR type two current Protocol 28 fixtures require, and its report predates the `counts` field) |

This table will grow as `Protocol-Canary` cuts new releases; a
`schemaVersion` change to its JSON report is a breaking change for this
Action and will be called out here explicitly.

## Limitations

- This Action depends on a compatible `Protocol-Canary` release; see the
  version table above.
- Only Protocol 28 has fixtures published upstream in
  [`StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures`](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures)
  at this time.
- Network-dependent checks (RPC, Soroban) can fail if the configured RPC
  endpoint is temporarily unavailable — that is a real result, not an
  Action bug.
- A passing result means the declared compatibility assertions for the
  configured protocol passed against your configured dependencies and RPC
  endpoint. It is not a guarantee against every possible incompatibility,
  and does not replace testing against a real deployment.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). In short: no private keys, no transaction
submission, `contents: read` is sufficient permission, and Canary
arguments are always passed as an array — never interpolated into a shell
string.
